Role & Persona: "You are a senior full-stack developer and software architect specializing in Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and modern e-commerce applications. Your code is clean, well-structured, documented, and follows best practices for performance, security, and scalability." 
Project Context: "We are building a high-performance, modern e-commerce web application named 'NexTech' specializing in gaming accessories and computers. The goal is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and feature-rich platform that can be demonstrated as a portfolio piece or used as a foundation for a real business." 
Core Technical Stack & Directives: 
Framework: Use Nuxt 3 (with SSR enabled for optimal SEO and performance). 
Styling & UI: Use Nuxt UI (which is based on Tailwind CSS) as the primary component library. Ensure the design is clean, modern, and responsive. 
State Management: Use Pinia for global state management (for user authentication, shopping cart, and filters). 
Data Fetching: Use Nuxt's useFetch() or $fetch for API calls. 
Backend & Database: Simulate a backend using a high-quality mock REST API service (e.g., JSON-Server, Mockoon, or a dedicated Nuxt server API layer with Nitro). The product data structure must be robust and include all necessary fields for the specified filters. 
Detailed Requirements (Chain-of-Thought): 
1. Project Setup & Architecture: 
Initialize a new Nuxt 3 project with a structured directory layout (/stores, /components, /composables, /pages, /assets). 
Install and configure Nuxt UI, Pinia, and any necessary icon library (e.g., nuxt-icon). 
2. Data Layer: 
Create a comprehensive, realistic mock dataset of at least 30 products (products.json) with the following fields: id, name, description, price, originalPrice (for deals), imageUrl (array), category, brand, inStock, isPreOrder, releaseDate, tags, specifications (object), rating, reviewCount. 
The dataset must include products across these categories: Gaming Mice, Keyboards, Headsets, Monitors, Pre-built PCs, Components (GPUs, CPUs), Consoles, Chairs, Controllers, and Software. 
3. Page Components & Features: 
Home Page (/): 
Hero Section: A visually striking banner featuring a current major promotion or highlight. 
Product Grid: Display all products in a responsive grid of cards. Each card must show image, name, price, rating, and an "Add to Cart" button. 
Filters Sidebar (Left): Implement a fixed, scrollable sidebar with at least these 10 interactive filters: Search by Name, Price Range (slider), Category (dropdown checkboxes), Brand (dropdown checkboxes), Availability (In Stock, Pre-Order), Customer Rating (star threshold), Deal (On Sale only), Compatibility (e.g., PC, PS5, Xbox), Features (e.g., RGB, Wireless, Mechanical), and Sort By (Price: Low-High, Price: High-Low, Rating, Newest). 
The filtering must be reactive and update the product grid in real-time without a full page reload. 
Authentication Pages (/login, /signup): 
Modern, minimalist forms with validation (using Nuxt UI's UForm component). 
Form fields: Login (Email, Password); Signup (Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password). 
Implement a mock authentication flow using Pinia. Upon successful login/signup, store a user token in a cookie and update the global auth state. 
Product Details Page (/products/[id]): 
Dynamic route displaying all product information: image gallery, title, price, full description, specifications table, customer reviews, and an "Add to Cart" button with quantity selector. 
A "You Might Also Like" section at the bottom. 
Shopping Cart Page (/cart): 
Display a list of items with image, name, price, quantity selector (with +/- buttons), and option to remove. 
Show a subtotal, estimated taxes, shipping cost, and order total. 
Provide a prominent "Proceed to Checkout" button. (Checkout process can be simulated). 
User Dashboard Page (/dashboard): (Protected Route) 
Display user profile information (Name, Email). 
Show order history (a list of mock orders with status, date, total). 
Links to manage account details. 
Pre-Orders & Upcoming Releases Page (/pre-orders): 
Filter and display only products where isPreOrder: true. 
Clearly display the releaseDate for each product. 
Deals & Bundles Page (/deals): 
Filter and display products where a deal tag is present or where originalPrice exists (showing the discount percentage). 
Consider displaying special curated "bundles" (groups of products sold together at a discount). 
Customer Support & Contact Us Page (/contact): 
A page with FAQs (accordion component). 
A contact form with fields for Name, Email, Subject, and Message, with client-side validation. 
4. Non-Functional Requirements: 
The application must be fully responsive and look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile. 
Code must be clean, well-commented, and use TypeScript where beneficial. 
Use Nuxt UI's components consistently throughout the app for a cohesive look and feel. 
Final Deliverable: 
"Provide a complete, step-by-step guide to create this project, including all necessary code snippets, the products.json dataset, configuration files (e.g., nuxt.config.ts, package.json), and instructions for running the application. The final output should be a functional, polished prototype of the 'NexTech' app."
